Goals:
1: Planning Phase
2: Basic coding and test room
3: more stuff here later.



Gameplay Mechanics:
  -Pressure management (using heat/cold) 
  -Flight stamina (unsure of how this will work entirely at the moment)
  -Basic health
 
  -Some form of upgrade progression in a metroid-vania style
    -some ideas for junk goes here.

Plot:
  - Let me think, so what if infertility has been a problem for a few years now, leading to the invention that went wrong. Something has to happen to that so there's enemies all the way to the end of the game, so it'd be easiest if a villain takes control of it and also the Fertility MacGuffin. The inventor can be your guide and ally, maybe even the person who helps get you upgrades with the stuff you find!
  -  What if he's sort of racing our heroine to the magical fertility thing? He could still ardently believe that the invention is the solution, and if he could just get this source of magic he could tweak it to produce perfectly normal dragonloons.

  
Tasks:
  -TBD
